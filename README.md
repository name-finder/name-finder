## Data source(s)

This project uses United States Social Security Administration data [available from SSA.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). The dataset labeled `National data` was used. It contains first names only. Per SSA, "All names are from Social Security card applications for births that occurred in the United States."
