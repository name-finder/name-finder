## Data Source & Background

This project uses United States Social Security Administration (SSA) data available via ["Beyond the Top 1000 Names" at SSA.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). National data was combined with territory-specific data. 

Actuarial tables [also via SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/HistEst/CohLifeTablesHome.html).

[Some important background and limitations, per SSA:](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/background.html)

>- All names are from Social Security card applications for births that occurred in the United States after 1879. Note that many people born before 1937 never applied for a Social Security card, so their names are not included in our data. For others who did apply, our records may not show the place of birth, and again their names are not included in our data.
>- Names are restricted to cases where the year of birth, sex, and state of birth are on record, and where the given name is at least 2 characters long.
>- Name data are tabulated from the "First Name" field of the Social Security Card Application. Hyphens and spaces are removed, thus Julie-Anne, Julie Anne, and Julieanne will be counted as a single entry.
>- Name data are not edited. For example, the sex associated with a name may be incorrect. Entries such as "Unknown" and "Baby" are not removed from the lists.
>- To safeguard privacy, we exclude from our tabulated lists of names those that would indicate, or would allow the ability to determine, names with fewer than 5 occurrences in any geographic area. If a name has less than 5 occurrences for a year of birth in any state, the sum of the state counts for that year will be less than the national count.


## Future Features

- combine with Google trends to correlate rises/falls in popularity of name w/ trends around that name
- game in which users guess (without looking it up) which of two names is more common
